# Project Summary
The Proposed application brings TO-DO Lists, Calendars, and Group T-DO Lists into one app. On their personal TO-DO List, the user can create, add, edit, and delete tasks. If the user is a part of a group, they can also create a Group TO-DO List, and be able to have a shared TO-DO List for their group. The Calendar allows the user to schedule and manage events, so that they can better manage their non-immediate events. These parts of the application together serve the purpose of assisting in the organization of the users daily and longer-period tasks. This app would be especially useful to any individual person, business, or organization looking for a tool to help manage personal or group events.

* Run the app on an emulator or android device

# Code Examples
These are few coding and design issues we have faced and solved them.

##### Problem 1: Radio button issue
The application uses Activity for initializing all its major UI components; however, implementing the.To-List priority features using Fragment with radio button components posed a challenge.
We resolved this by implementing onCreateView on the fragment activity. Also, we created the onCheckedEventListener, to enable the application to detect the radio button clicked, then render the priority accordingly.


        RadioGroup radioGroup = (RadioGroup) tView .findViewById(R.id.radioGroup);
           radioGroup.setOnCheckedChangeListener(new RadioGroup.OnCheckedChangeListener()
                {
                    public void onCheckedChanged(RadioGroup group, int checkedId) {
                        // checkedId is the RadioButton selected

                        switch(checkedId) {
                            case R.id.radButton1:
                                Toast.makeText(getActivity(), "Radio 1", Toast.LENGTH_LONG ).show();
                                mPriority = 1;
                                break;
                            case R.id.radButton2:
                            Toast.makeText(getActivity(), "Radio 2", Toast.LENGTH_LONG ).show();
                                mPriority = 2;
                                break;
                            case R.id.radButton3:
                                mPriority = 3;
                                Toast.makeText(getActivity(), "Radio 3", Toast.LENGTH_LONG ).show();
                                break;
                        }
                    }
                });
#####  Problem 2: Create a task based on Priority
Most To-do list do not implement or assigned priority to their task. we tried to implement to improve usability on assigning priority to each task based on color code and it posed challenge for us.
We did a layer out that accepts three types of colors for the priorities and created a function that can detects the priority of the code and programmatically assigned a color to each task.



    private int getPriorityColor(int priority) {
        int priorityColor = 0;

        switch(priority) {
            case 1: priorityColor = ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.materialRed);
                break;
            case 2: priorityColor = ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.materialOrange);
                break;
            case 3: priorityColor = ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.materialYellow);
                break;
            default: break;
        }
        return priorityColor;
    }
 

##### Problem 3: Radio button issue Retreiving data from Firebase to Swipe ListView
We faced issue in fetching data from firebase database to Custom Listview.  The data was to be retrieved using Realtime database library of FIrebase which uses a class and constructor through which the data will be passed and added on to the list. The issue was solved by renaming the variables through which data was being retrieved.
The solution was to keep the name of the variables same as the child names in database.

    public TaskDetails() {
      }

    public TaskDetails(String TaskTitle, String TaskDueDate, String TaskPriority) {
        this.TaskTitle = TaskTitle;
        this.TaskDueDate = TaskDueDate;
        this.TaskPriority = TaskPriority;
    }
##### This function is a constructor of the class TaskDetails which gets the value from database and returns it to the list as shown below:

              public void onDataChange(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot) {
                // This method is called once with the initial value and again
                // whenever data at this location is updated.
                list.clear();
                for (DataSnapshot postSnapshot : dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {
                Log.d(TAG,"postSnapshot..."+postSnapshot );

                    try{
                        TaskDetails task = postSnapshot.getValue(TaskDetails.class);
                        Log.d(TAG,"Task is..."+task.getTaskTitle().toString() );
                        list.add(task.getTaskTitle().toString()+"\n\n"+task.getTaskPriority().toString()+"\n\n"+task.getTaskDueDate());
                    }
                    catch (Exception e){
                    Log.e(TAG, "Received an exception on data value change.. " + e.getMessage() );
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                    
                    adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
                }

            }
